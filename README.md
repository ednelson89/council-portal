#CouncilOfBros-Portal
Tabletop Gaming portal for the Council of Bros

###Design Summary:
This application will be a single page app designed to provide a character sheet and game materials collection hub for commonly played Tabletop RPGs. The intent is to provide user accounts (using O-Auth) so that characters may be tied to users and certain information on a character sheet may remain privileged if the user wishes.

The front end will be developed using the javascript framework VueJS, which will allow for rapid but modular development of a user interface. Using a mix of components from Vuetify and Bootstrap-Vue, all necessary front end components should be provided for. Custom character sheets will be made for each game the Council plays, though if the council wishes to add a game, they should give a heads up to allow time for the form to be built.
